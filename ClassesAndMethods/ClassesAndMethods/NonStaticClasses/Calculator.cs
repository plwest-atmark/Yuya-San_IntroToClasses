    /// This is the Calculator class.  It will contain "Methods" that will perform "calculations".
    /// 
    /// It should function "similar" to a real life calculator when it is finished.
    /// 
    /// To use this, another "class" will create an "instance" of this class.  Meaning it will create a new Calculator.
    /// 
    /// To do this you use the following code:
    /// 
    /// Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    /// 
    /// You can name your variable whatever you thing is appropriate. In other words we could also create one with the following:
    /// 
    /// Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    /// 
    /// 
    /// To use the Calculator, you use the "name" you gave it and "call a method" that is inside of it.
    /// 
    /// You have to give it the correct "arguments" or "parameters".  Each method can return a value. This value should be placed
    ///     inside a variable in the other class.
    ///     
    /// For example:
    /// 
    /// Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    /// var a = 5;
    /// var b = 6;
    /// 
    /// var sum = calc.AddInt(a,b);
    /// Console.WriteLine($"The sum of {a} and {b} = {sum}.");
    /// 
    /// This will "use" the Calculator called calc to add two integer variables together. It will "return" an int as an answer.
